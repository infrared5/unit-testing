Introduction
===
> Example of an ActionScript project that incorporates [FlexUnit](https://github.com/flexunit/flexunit) testing with [mockolate](https://github.com/drewbourne/mockolate) for mocks/stubs/spies. Though it is an ActionScript project, example can translate to Flex project as they both utilize the [Flex SDK](http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Download%20Flex%204.6/).

Requirements
===
The examples are written as a web-based ActionScript project and were built against Flex SDK 4.6 with FlexUnit 4.1, but should be comparible to any 4.x versions of both the Flex SDK and FlexUnit.

* [Flex SDK 4.x](http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Download%20Flex%204.6/) (only tested with releases under Adobe, not Apache)
* [FlexUnit 4.x](https://github.com/flexunit/flexunit)
* [mockolate](https://github.com/drewbourne/mockolate)

Included in the example directories are Eclipse project files to easily get setup and working in [Flash Builder 4.x](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html).

Todo
===
**Resolve dependency on FB 4.x:**

* setup scripts to download required libraries.
* ANT scripts to build projects (also demonstrate integration with CI).
