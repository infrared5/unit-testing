Introduction
===
> The following is an example of using [jasmine-flex](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/jasmine-flex/wiki) - an ActionScript library that provides BDD-syntax as a port of [JasmineJS](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) - and [mockolate](http://mockolate.org/).

Requirements
===
* [Flex SDK 4.x](http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Download%20Flex%204.6/) (only tested with releases under Adobe, not Apache)
* [jasmine-flex](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/jasmine-flex/wiki)
* [mockolate](https://github.com/drewbourne/mockolate)

Included in the example directories are Eclipse project files to easily get setup and working in [Flash Builder 4.x](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html).

Todo
===
**Resolve dependency on FB 4.x:**

* setup scripts to download required libraries.
* ANT scripts to build projects (also demonstrate integration with CI).
